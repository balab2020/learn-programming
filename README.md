# learn-programming

> Learn multiple programming languages with real time use cases hand in hand. You could understand them if you are familar with anyone programming languages.

I assume, you are already familiar with one programming language and may want to learn other one. This repository has markdown files catogorized with different concepts from data types, oops..etc. My plan is create one use case and try to achieve the same with different languages.

Let get start with **Hello World** here.

## c#

```csharp
class ConsoleApplication 
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
	    var helloWorld = "Hello World";
		Console.WriteLine(helloWorld);
    }
}
```

## javascipt

```js
const helloworld = 'Hello World';
console.log(helloworld);
```

## python

```python
helloWorld = "Hello World";
print(helloWorld);
```
